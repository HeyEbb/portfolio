## Welcome

Welcome to my Next.js portfolio project! I've embarked on this journey to showcase my development skills while creating a dynamic and engaging portfolio. As I continue to work on this project, my goal is to develop fun, mini-projects as components that can be easily shared and demonstrated. Furthermore, since I intend to keep this project open source, everyone is welcome to explore and learn from the code.

## Deployment

While I do plan to host this portfolio, I haven't had the opportunity to do so just yet. However, if you'd like to run this project locally, please follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run it as you would a typical Next.js project. For more information on how to do this, refer to the Next.js documentation.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
