                This website serves as a comprehensive repository for tracking
                my personal goals, ongoing projects, and notable achievements.
                Beyond being a personal resource, it also functions as a
                platform to exhibit my skills. I envision this website as an
                invaluable tool for self-reflection, allowing me to assess my
                growth and evolution as both a designer and developer.

                Constructed using Next.js, a React framework, with styling
                implemented through Tailwind CSS, and design conceptualised
                using Figma, this website reflects a commitment to utilising
                cutting-edge technologies. Hosted on Vercel, the platform
                ensures seamless accessibility and performance. In the immediate
                future, the site is poised to evolve into a small-scale Content
                Management System (CMS), facilitating the hosting of a blog to
