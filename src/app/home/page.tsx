              <p className="">
                This website is a comprehensive repository for tracking my
                personal goals, ongoing projects, and notable achievements. It
                not only serves as a personal resource but also showcases my
                skills. I envision it as an invaluable tool for self-reflection,
                enabling me to assess my growth and evolution as both a designer
                and developer.

                Built with Next.js, a React framework, styled with Tailwind CSS,
                and designed in Figma, this site embodies a commitment to using
                cutting-edge technologies. Hosted on Vercel, it guarantees
                seamless accessibility and performance. In the near future, I
                plan to transform this site into a small-scale Content
                Management System (CMS), which will include a blog for sharing
                insights, progress updates, and creative ideas.
